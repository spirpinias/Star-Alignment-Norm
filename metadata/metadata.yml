description: "STAR is an aligner designed to specifically address many of the challenges
  of RNA-seq data mapping using a strategy to account for spliced alignments (meaning
  that RNA sequences can successfully align to the DNA genome). This capsule will
  run STAR to map single end or paired end fastq.gz files. \n\nhttps://github.com/alexdobin/STAR"
